            <h1> University Domains and Names API</h1>
        </div>
        <div id = "APIInfo">
        <p>The University Domains and Names API allows clients to make a 
        query to a database of university names and univerysity information using 
        a search term. For example, a client can query the name "Tufts" to 
        receive a JSON object that contains information about Tufts, including its full name.
        Clients can also query information about schools using a search name and a 
        country to narrow down API results</p>
        
        <p>I found the API at: https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/
        https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/</p>
        
        <p>The options used for the API request was "GET"</p>
        
        <p>Two applications where this API would be useful would be:</p>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> On a job application form, applicants must usually type in the name 
        of their school or search from a drop down menu. Using this API upon 
        an applicant searching for their school name would ensure that the selected
        school the applicant is choosing is a valid school that falls under 
        one consistent name between all applicants. For example, two applicants 
        will have "Tufts University" specifically under their profiles, and filtering 
        done by recruiting can specifically look for students that went to a 
        specific schools, indidicated by the unified name. </p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Websites that offer to give information about universities to 
        their readers can utilize this API to redirect the reader to the 
        university page, since the university web pages are also returned, thus 
        addding another feature to their site that would not have been feasible 
        by manually adding all school's sites to their own webpage. </p>
