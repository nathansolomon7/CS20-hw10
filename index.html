        <p>The omdb API allows clients to make a 
        query to a database of movie information using 
        a search term of the title. For example, a client can query the name "Jaws" to 
        receive a JSON object that contains information about the movie Jaws
        </p>
        
        <p>I found the API at: https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/
        https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/</p>
        
        <p>The options used for the API request was a "GET" request, where for the 
        AJAX method, i used an XMLHttpRequest while the Fetch method used an HTTP request.
        A key is used within the request to specify the search term of the university/ universities
        that the client requests.</p>
        
        <p>Two applications where this API would be useful would be:</p>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> A developer can query movie information to their site, 
        whether it is a trivia platfrom that relies on movie information as data 
        or their own movie-based sites</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Developers can use the API to develop analytics 
        about trends in film making over time, as the API also allows you to search 
        in batch results and can filter results with other terms other than title.
        I only pull up the first result for simplicity on this assignment.</p>
